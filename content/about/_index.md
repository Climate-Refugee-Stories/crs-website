**Climate Refugee Stories** is a multimedia narrative, archiving, and education project that uplifts the stories of people around the world who have been displaced by direct or indirect impacts of climate change, and documents the ways communities are resilient in the face of overlapping crises--including the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
There are currently no legal protections for climate migrants in international law. In many places, Indigenous relationships to land and natural resources continue to go unrecognized, and environmental defenders face policing and persecution. Patterns of displacement and inequality are further exacerbated by increasing militarization, border controls, and politics of climate denial.
 
But there is hope. We invite storytellers and audiences to debate and define **climate refugees** for themselves - to explore the historical, political, economic, and environmental causes of migration in order to bridge movements for social and environmental justice.
