The United States maintains the largest immigration detention and deportation system in the world.  On any given day, over 50,000 people are held in a network of over 200 federal, local, and privately contracted detention facilities across the country, while over 400,000 people are deported each year. 

Although it is considered a "civil" form of confinement, immigration detention looks and functions like prison.  Human rights and due process are routinely denied in this system that operates largely in secret with little public accountability.
