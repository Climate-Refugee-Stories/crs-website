Our curriculum includes a broad multi-unit â€œClimate-Induced Migration: A High School Curriculum'' and a range of K-12 curriculum units in a variety of disciplines developed and piloted by teachers in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district in North Carolina.
Curriculum developed with support from National Geographic Society and the Charlotte Teachers Institute.
