      bio: |
        Project Director [Tina Shull](http://kristinashull.com/), PhD, is an Assistant Professor of Post-1960 US History at UNC Charlotte. 
        She has taught and published widely in the fields of US foreign relations, immigration enforcement, and 
        climate migration. As a 2016 Soros Justice Fellow at Freedom for Immigrants, she founded [IMM Print](https://imm-print.com/), a 
        digital platform for people affected by immigration detention to share their stories. Her forthcoming 
        book with UNC Press, Detention Empire, explores the rise of immigration detention in the United States 
        since the 1980s. Shull is also a National Geographic explorer and a Climate Reality Project leader.
